# VirtualBox installation guide

## Overview

VirtualBox is a virtualization software for running multiple virtual machines (VMs) on your computer, at the same time. For example, you can run Windows 10, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux on your Windows 11 machine. You even can run Windows Server and Linux Server on your machine. Within the disk space and memory limits, you can run as many VMs as you need. VirtualBox is easy to use yet powerful in performance. 

## Supported operating system and hardware

You can run VirtualBox on the following host operating systems (OS):
- __x86-64 Windows__
  - Windows 11
  - Windows 10
  - Windows Server 2025
  - Windows Server 2022
- __x86-64 macOS__
  - 14 (Sonoma)
  - 13 (Ventura)
  - 12 (Monterey)
  - 11 (Big Sur)
- __x86-64 Linux__
  - _Ubuntu_
    - 24.04 LTS
    - 22.04 LTS
    - 20.04 LTS
  - _Debian_
    - 12 (Bookworm)
    - 11 (Bullseye)
  - _Red Hat Enterprise Linux_
    - 9
    - 8
  - _Fedora_
    - 41
    - 40
  - _SUSE Linux Enterprise server_ 
    - 15
To run the application smoothly, Intel host CPUs must have __SSE2__ (Streaming SIMD Extensions 2).

## Prerequisite

* Before installing VirtualBox, you need to enable _hardware virtualization_ feature on your CPU such as __Intel VT-X__ or __AMD-V in UEFI/BIOS__ of your host machine. Otherwise, when you try to run 64-bit guest OSs, you can get the error: __VT-x is not available__. 
* When you are using a Windows machine, you need to uninstall __Hyper-V__ before installing VirtualBox. Otherwise, __Hyper-V__ could block hardware virtualization extensions required by VirtualBox to run VMs.
